# Operation Food Rescue

Hack For a Cause 2018 Git repository for Team Internet Relay Food

The challenge was to create apps that would help put excess food on the tables of people who 
need it instead of into landfills.  In order to do this our team created a REST API that would 
allow any apps built on any platform to share data and participate in the exchange of surplus 
food, and two client apps that make use of the API.

The project consists of these components:
* [API](api/node)
* [Responsive Web Application](responsive-site)
* [Android App](android)
